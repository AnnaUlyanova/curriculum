# Git branching and merging 

## Overview
Git allows you to fork off 'branches' from any commit and add add new commits to that branch. This is a powerful tool for developers. It means you can group a sequence of commits as you work on a new feature. Then you can bring changes from your feature branch back into your master branch.
