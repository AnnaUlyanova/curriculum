# Reading Documentation
Know thy tools.
## Overview
How do you get to know new tools? Start with the documentation! 
This is the most comprehensive source of information for tool users (you!).

**Docs arenâ€™t designed so you have to painstakingly read every word.**

Documentation is designed to cater to a huge range of skill levels. This means you have to develop the skills to filter out what is useful to you.

Skimming over the documentation is the best way to familiarise yourself with your tool. For example, a quick glance at the functions for Javascript Arrays will save you a lot of time in the future. 

If you are familiar with the capabilities of your tools you will build awesomer things and write elegant code.

Hot tips:
- Look for code examples
- Use page search ctrl+f/cmd+f to search keywords
