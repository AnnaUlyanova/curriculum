# Unblocking

## Overview
++ CHECK THIS WITH MIX/PIET/JV ++
It's a guarantee that you'll be blocked at some point! You learn best through struggling, so this is OK
But there are many strategies for overcoming that block. Here are some ideas, or you may develop your own. The point is that you have a methodical strategy that keeps you calm and productive, so you can avoid a black hole of frustration.

One technique is rubber ducky programming, the act of verbalizing your problem, then realizing you know the answer. Read more about it here: http://www.rubberduckdebugging.com/

Or answer these 3 questions: What is the problem? What do I know? What don't I know?

After putting your problem into words, and you still haven’t figured it out, it’s time to google.

Especially as a beginner, it can be hard to even verbalize what you don’t understand. Even if it seems fruitless, put together a few key words, it’s likely some answer will be returned. 

For example, say you can’t figure out how to get the last element out of a javascript array. Feeling foolish, you try googling “get last thing in array javascript” - this actually returns perfectly valid results.

It has been said that programming is being paid to be frustrated and confused. So good luck with your unblocking!
