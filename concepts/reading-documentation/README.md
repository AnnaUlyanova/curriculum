# Reading Documentation
Know thy tools.
## Overview
How do you get to know new tools? Start with the documentation! 
This is the most comprehensive source of information for tool users (you!).

**Docs aren’t designed so you have to  painstakingly read every word.**

Skimming over the documentation is the best way to familiarise yourself with your tool. For example, a quick glance at the functions for Javascript Arrays will save you a lot of time in the future. 

If you are familiar with the capabilities of your tools you will build awesomer things and write elegant code.

Documentation is designed to cater to a huge range of skill levels. This means you have to develop the skills to filter out what is and isn’t important for you.

Tips:
- Look for code examples
- Use page search ctrl+f/cmd+f to search keywords

You've used a bunch of new tools recently - how well do you know them? Let's look at Arrays.

t's invaluable to 
This is an important skill. It is invaluable to know how to go straight to the source when you’re figuring out how to use a new array function for example. 

Throughout the Udacity course, there were links to the MDN (Mozilla Developer Network) docs.
This is a resource for developers, maintained by the community of developers and technical writers and hosting many documents on a wide variety of subjects, such as: HTML5, JavaScript, CSS, Web APIs and Node.





There are a lot of answers to be found in documentation. For example, take the documentation on JS arrays: 

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array

To test your documentation abilitites try this exercise:

what single function could I use for:
getting the last element of the array and returning it? answer = .pop()
determining if a variable is an array or not? answer = .isArray()
getting everything in the array and joining it all into one string? answer =.join()
