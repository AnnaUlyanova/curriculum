# Git Best Practices

## Overview

**Git** is beautiful version control software - it manages and records changes to files and documents in a project. 
This means that it is possible to:
  1. Have one master copy of the project
  2. Give everyone access to a copy of the project that they can work on
  3. Have many people working on the same project without messing up each others work
  4. Roll back to previous versions of the project

**GitHub** is an online interface to easily use Git to collaborate with many people. GitHub hosts your projects online and adds some extra functionality to git such as 'issues' and 'pull requests'.

**Git vs GitHub**  
Git is the local tool  
GitHub is the remote service for projects that use git  

**Wow. What?**
If everything seems unclear now, don't worry. Time and practice are the best way to let things sink in. It'll make more sense using Git and GitHub in your own projects.
