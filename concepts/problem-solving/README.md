# Problem Solving

## Overview
You'll be constantly facing challenging problems! Resolving problems is an art that you'll be practicing at EDA. Tough problems are the best learning opportunities. 

There are many strategies for resolving problems. The point is that you have a methodical strategy that keeps you calm and productive, so you can avoid a black hole of frustration.

## Steps
1. Pseudocode
2. Try something!
3. Debug
  - Rubber ducky
  - Read error message
  - Console.log()
  - Google error message
4. Blocked?
    1. Ask peers on cohort slack
    2. Tag a coach
4. Reflect

**1. PseudoCode**    
First step: don't code - you'll get tied up in syntax and minor details. Work out what you actually want to do by [pseudocoding](/concepts/pseudocode). Get up. Go for a walk. Think about it.

**2. Try Something!**  
It won't work (95% of the time). Great! Some code is better than no code. Now we've got some errors (bugs) to work with. We're now in the land of 'Debugging'!
If you don't know how to approach the problem with code, google parts of your pseudocode for ideas.

Use the console in your browser to explore the behaviour of functions you think might help.

**3. Debug**  
Debugging is the process of **isolating** an issue and **resolving** it.

*Rubber Ducky Method*  
One great technique is the [rubber ducky method](http://www.rubberduckdebugging.com/). Explain to your rubber duck: What is the problem? What do I know? What don't I know?

*Read the error message*  
If you have one. Your app is trying to tell you how to fix it! Don't be intimidated by long, complex output. Scan the output for may show you exactly what's going wrong. 
Look for line numbers in files you recognise.

*Console.log()*  
Remove your assumptions about the values of your variables - use a console.log() to inspect their value at the various stages of your code, and test the behaviour of your logic. 

*Google*  
Especially as a beginner, it can be hard to even verbalize what you don’t understand. Even if it seems fruitless, put together a few key words, it’s likely some answer will be returned. 

For example, say you can’t figure out how to get the last element out of a javascript array. Feeling foolish, you try googling “get last thing in array javascript” - this actually returns perfectly valid results.

If you have an error message that is more specific than "undefined is not a function", try searching on that too

It has been said that programming is being paid to be frustrated and confused. So good luck with your problem solving!

**4. Blocked?**  
If you've been problem solving for over 15 mins and you feel like you've hit a dead end:  
1. Post a message in your cohort slack group. It's likely someone else has had and resolved a similar issue, or has the perspective, understanding or experience to help you resolve your issue.  
2. If your cohort can't help you, tag a coach in slack, we'll help you out as soon as possible.  

**5. Reflect**  
Which approaches worked well?    
What did I get stuck on?   
Why did it take so long to resolve a silly bug? (an oft asked question!).   
How long did it take to isolate the bug?  
Did I stay calm?  
Did my mindset help/hinder me?
