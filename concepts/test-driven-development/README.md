Time cost now pays off later - Technical debt
Crucial for maintainability - 
Own sanity "backed by wall of tests" - fearless refactoring
Solution quality - TDD FORCES modularity,
Documentation - comments decay - documentation == tests and naming of variables and functions
'Spec' - Specification - Technical Specification - show examples
    - hence comes firs
A way of pseudocoding -
Problem solving technique - Initially writing tests will be a problem, then will become problem solving tool. like learning to touchtype.
