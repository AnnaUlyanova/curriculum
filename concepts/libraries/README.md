# Libraries

## Overview
A Library is a tool. A Framework is a way of life.  
e.g JQuery is a Javascript library, Bootstrap/Skeleton are CSS frameworks

Here are a variety of examples rephrased in different ways:

- A Library you can use whatever tiny part helps you. A Framework you must commit your entire project to.
- A Library provides a set of functions that you can use in your code.
- A Framework embodies some abstract design, with more behavior built in. A framework is an architecture which you design your code around.

### Good
- Using Libraries means that you don't have to re-invent the wheel, and can use well written, well tested code that other people have written - for example Jquery's dollar sign selector `$(".class-name)` rather than typing `document.getElementsByClassName("example")` in raw Javascript

### Bad 
- Using libraries introduces dependencies on third party code, so pick a library that is stable. Using libraries also hides the 'raw' code, which can be unhelpful for learning.   
- You also have to learn a new syntax, a bit like learning another language.

## Prerequisites

- None

You are comfortable:
- understanding what libraries are
- knowing what they are used for
