# Git Basics

## Overview
Git is beautiful version control software - it manages and records changes to files and documents in a project. 
This means that it is possible to:
  1. Have one master copy of the project
  2. Give everyone access to a copy of the project that they can work on
  3. Have many people working on the same project without messing up each others work
  4. Roll back to previous versions of the project
