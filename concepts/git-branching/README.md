# Git branching and merging 

## Overview
Git allows you to fork off 'branches' from any commit and add add new commits to that branch. This is a powerful tool for developers. It means you can group a sequence of commits as you work on a new feature for example. 
If you want to bring changes from one branch into another you can 'merge' them in.
