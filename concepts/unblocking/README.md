# Unblocking

## Overview
It's a guarantee that you'll get blocked often! People learn best through being challenged, so this is OK.

There are many strategies for resolving blocks. The point is that you have a methodical strategy that keeps you calm and productive, so you can avoid a black hole of frustration.

## Rubber Ducky Method
One technique is [rubber ducky programming](http://www.rubberduckdebugging.com/). Explain to your rubber duck: What is the problem? What do I know? What don't I know?

Still not resolved? It’s time to google.

## Google

Especially as a beginner, it can be hard to even verbalize what you don’t understand. Even if it seems fruitless, put together a few key words, it’s likely some answer will be returned. 

For example, say you can’t figure out how to get the last element out of a javascript array. Feeling foolish, you try googling “get last thing in array javascript” - this actually returns perfectly valid results.

It has been said that programming is being paid to be frustrated and confused. So good luck with your unblocking!
