# Design and Development process

## Overview
Having a process and a plan of action is important when developing websites and web applications. Each designer / developer / agency will have a unique take on the design process, but most use combination of the same phases and or elements.

Its up to you to understand the importance of process, experiment a bit and to develop your own.

### A Typical process:
Below is an example of a design and development process. Your initial `username.github.io` website won't require such in depth analysis, planing and design, but as the course continues you'll need to have a good understanding of process and begin applying it to your projects.


#### Phase 1: Analysis and information gathering.
- Website purpose
- Website goals
- Target audience
- Brain storm

#### Phase 2: Planning
- Site map
- Website structure
- Technologies used

#### Phase 3: Design

- Visual style
- Usability, UI, UX (creating interfaces for the best possible user experience)

#### Phase 4: Content

- Optimized for visitors and SEO

#### Phase 5: Development
- Create website using
  - HTML
  - CSS
  - databases
  - other technologies
  - responsiveness

#### Phase 6: Testing
- technical testing (test features, code and scripts)
- Browser compatibility
- Ask " Does the website fulfill its purpose"

#### Phase 7: Deployment
- Monitor
- Fix bugs
- future maintenance

## Designing your github.io website
You're website will become a collection of your Dev Academy work. You can take you're website in many directions, but to begin it will require pages for your profile, blog and projects. As the course goes on, you can apply the techniques that you learn to turn your website into anything you wish. Some transform them into an online portfolio / CV's. Some purchase their own domain names to personalise their site, while many simply continue to track their journey through the writing of their blogs.

Think about the purpose of your website and who you want to visit it. Potential employers will often seek out a candidates online profile and blogs to learn a little about your process and your experiences. Do you want to be designing your site with this in mind? Or do you want to use it simply as a means to complete your assignments.

Its good to ask yourself
  1. What is your site's primary goal or purpose?
  2. What kind of content will your site feature?
  3. What is the best way to share that content with users?
  4. Think about your target audience. What are their interests and how do you see your site addressing them?
  5. How do you think most users will find your site?
  6. What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.
