# Technical Debt Part 1

## Overview
Writing tidy code is like doing your dishes after you cook. If you don't do the dishes, they'll stack up, get mouldy, start smelling. When you or someone else needs to cook again, it'll be a painful - and necessary - process to do all the old dishes before you cook something new.  
Don't leave a costly mess - leave an inviting clean bench.

## Prerequisites
None

## Capabilities
You are comfortable:

- **Perfectly** indenting all your code
- Validating your code with:
  - Online tools
  - Linters
- Following styleguides

## Resources

- [Validate HTML](resources/html-validation-TUTORIAL)
- [Validate CSS](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)
- [Google HTML & CSS styleguide](resources/html-css-google-styleguide-ARTICLE)
- [Formatting & Indenting Your HTML](resources/html-formatting-ARTICLE)  

Some styleguides will differ in opinion on topics. The one thing they all agree on is the importance of consistency.  
Google styleguide's parting words:
>Be consistent.

>If you’re editing code, take a few minutes to look at the code around you and determine its style. If they use spaces around all their arithmetic operators, you should too. If their comments have little boxes of hash marks around them, make your comments have little boxes of hash marks around them too.

>The point of having style guidelines is to have a common vocabulary of coding so people can concentrate on what you’re saying rather than on how you’re saying it. We present global style rules here so people know the vocabulary, but local style is also important. If code you add to a file looks drastically different from the existing code around it, it throws readers out of their rhythm when they go to read it. Avoid this.
