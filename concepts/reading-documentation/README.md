# Reading Documentation

## Overview
This is an important skill. It is invaluable to know how to go straight to the source when you’re figuring out how to use a new array function for example. 

Throughout the Udacity course, there were links to the MDN (Mozilla Developer Network) docs.
This is a resource for developers, maintained by the community of developers and technical writers and hosting many documents on a wide variety of subjects, such as: HTML5, JavaScript, CSS, Web APIs and Node.

Documentation is designed to cater to a huge range of skill levels. This means you have to develop the skills to filter out what is and isn’t important for you. 

Docs aren’t designed so you have to  painstakingly read every word. It’s best to do a quick skim, paying attention to the examples of code, and re reading it slower if you think you’ve found what you’re looking for. 

There are a lot of answers to be found in documentation. For example, take the documentation on JS arrays: 

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array

To test your documentation abilitites try this exercise:

what single function could I use for:
getting the last element of the array and returning it? answer = .pop()
determining if a variable is an array or not? answer = .isArray()
getting everything in the array and joining it all into one string? answer =.join()
