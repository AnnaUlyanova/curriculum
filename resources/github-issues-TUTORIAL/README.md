# Github issues

> Issues are a great way to keep track of tasks, enhancements, and bugs for your projects. They’re kind of like email—except they can be shared and discussed with the rest of your team. Most software projects have a bug tracker of some kind. GitHub’s tracker is called Issues, and has its own section in every repository.

Here at dev academy, one of our biggest projects is our curriculum, and we use issues to develop it.

You can work with us to craft ever better curriculum and contribute to the education sector by creating issues for:

- problems you find in our curriculum (typos, broken links etc.)
- improvements to our curriculum that you can see (there are amazing new learning resources created every ten minutes, maybe you'll find the gems before we do!)
- issues you find in other packages you'll use

Follow the [create and issue guide](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-issue/) to create an issue in your cohort's repo.

Using issues will prepare you to contribute to the wonderful open source world. 

Us web developers can build amazing things incredibly quickly, but only thanks to the thousands and thousands of hours of many generous open source developers. The Linux operating system you're reading this in was built in this way, and a large proportion of tools and packages you'll use in every project are open source (most of the internet is hosted on Linux machines!).

It's important to recognise the value in this, either by contributing to the open source ecosystem (or other 'public good' ecosystems) yourself, or by paying koha (gift) to the open source packages you use (this isn't yet easy to do, but we're working on it...).
